## Creative Coding (DM-GY 6063) - Mid Term 


### Milestone #3

#### what you’ve done this week
- Map the x-positions of the layer circles to change according to the position of the mouse.
- Created and animated textures in Adobe After Effects.
- Applied textures to the dream layer circles and background.
- Edited appearance and positioning of time displays.
- Animated looped circles in the background.

#### Description of the final interactivity or time-based logic
- Interactivity: The layer circles will move together with the mouse along the x-axis.
- Time-based logic: The time on the layer circles are directly linked to real time, operating 12x - 20736x slower depending on the layer.

### Milestone #2

#### What you’ve done this week
- Researched and successfully built the foundation of the project, which is to slow down time for the individual dream layers and have them displayed on circles.

#### Description of the files, classes, objects or arrays you will use
- Made objects for the circles so that I can easily change their dimensions whenever. For arrays, I'll apply them when I start adding effects that are triggered when the mouse hovers over the circles.

#### Description of any interactivity or time-based logic
- The project revolves around real-time and is constantly updating. I intend it such that it is collection of clocks that show the current time for each dream layer. As for the interactivity, I want the circles to display their current time when the mouse hovers over them.

#### Description of functions you have written or will write
- The circles are placeholders and will be turned into custom functions as I move on to adding details. I'll also add ellipses orbiting around the circles, operating like second hands of a clock.


### Milestone #1

#### What book, album or movie did you choose? What is it about?
- Inception by Christoper Nolan

- It is a film about a thief named Dom Cobb, who steals confidential information from people's dreams. He is given the chance to have his criminal past erased and be reuinited with his children, on the condition that he successfully performs 'inception', in which he has to plant an idea in someone's mind without them realizing it. This task involves him and his team descending down layers of dreams, with time passing slower with every layer

#### What aspect of the film will you include in your poster?
- The 5 different layers of dreams
- How time flows differently in each layer

#### Is it interactive? time-based? both?
- Both!

#### What ideas would you like to explore or experiment with?
- Circles are layered on top of each other, representing the dream layers
- Time-based: Circles will rotate at different speeds
- Interactive: Shows amount of time elapsed when rolling the mouse over circle

#### Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings we’ve done?
- I am really inspired by W.E.B. Du Bois' work. Plate 22 (page 95-96) and plate 25 (pages 101-102) especially helped me in brainstorming ideas on how I can depict the passage of time for each dream layer.
