## Creative Coding (DM-GY 6063) - Mid Term 


### Milestone #2

### what you’ve done this week
- Researched and figured out how to slow down time for the individual dream layers. 

### description of the files, classes, objects or arrays you will use
- Made objects out of the circles so that I can easily change their dimensions whenever.

### description of any interactivity or time-based logic
- The entire works revolves around real-time. I intend it such that it is collection of clocks that show the current time for each dream layer. As for the interactivity, I want the circles to show the time when the mouse rolls over it.

### description of functions you have written or will write
- The current circles are placeholders and will be turned into custom functions to add more details, such as the arrow sticking that will act like the second hand of a clock.


#### Milestone #1

### What book, album or movie did you choose? What is it about?
- Inception by Christoper Nolan

- It is a film about a thief named Dom Cobb, who steals confidential information from people's dreams. He is given the chance to have his criminal past erased and be reuinited with his children, on the condition that he successfully performs 'inception', in which he has to plant an idea in someone's mind without them realizing it. This task involves him and his team descending down layers of dreams, with time passing slower with every layer

### What aspect of the film will you include in your poster?
- The 5 different layers of dreams
- How time flows differently in each layer

### Is it interactive? time-based? both?
- Both!

### What ideas would you like to explore or experiment with?
- Circles are layered on top of each other, representing the dream layers
- Time-based: Circles will rotate at different speeds
- Interactive: Shows amount of time elapsed when rolling the mouse over circle

### Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings we’ve done?
- I am really inspired by W.E.B. Du Bois' work. Plate 22 (page 95-96) and plate 25 (pages 101-102) especially helped me in brainstorming ideas on how I can depict the passage of time for each dream layer.
